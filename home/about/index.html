						<h2>My Background</h2>
						<div>
&emsp;&emsp;My name is He Sun, 24 years old, and I was born and raised in Taiwan, benefited from my family atmosphere, I am a person who is always willing to listen and consider opinions from different people.
As the saying goes “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it”.
When I graduated from junior high school, I decided to leave my hometown for a better high school education and that led to my responsibilities for daily life and ability to manage my schedules.
Currently studying in National Taiwan University of Science and Technology Electrical Engineering department as a master student and planning to graduate in July 2022.
My research area is video encoding which includes traditional approaches and deep-learning based methods.
To fully engage my research, I enrolled in numerous graduate level courses such as Data Compression, Multimedia Signal Processing, Practical AOI and Machine Vision courses.
I implemented U-Net for brain tumor recognition by analyzing Brain MRI images.
I also modified µC/OS-II source code in the kernel level to achieve different type of scheduler and resource synchronization for optimizing utilization of recourses within the embedded OS Implementation course.
This semester, I participated in the courses namely Practice of Big Data Analysis, Machine Learning for Practical Optical Design, Multimedia Communications, Embedded System Software Design, Design and Application in Internet of Things.
This allows me to keep me competitive and having the top of the state knowledge in my research related field. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;Outside of schoolwork, I also have real world coding experience in 2019 in POU CHEN GROUP computer vision department as an intern full-stack engineer.
Designed web UI/UX for shoe factory quality control systems in Vietnam and established communication between front back end for real time monitoring data updating and camera parameters adjustment.
I currently work for ALLTEK to develop terminal AI applications on Kneron KL520 edge computing device on limited computing speed and storage space by pruning model since 2020.
